# HelmholtzSim
A simulation of the magnetic field due to three sets of rectuangular helmholtz coils. Created by Kevin Wen for Dr. Heinzen's research lab, Summer 2021

Files:

HelmholtzData.py - defines the helmholtz coil objects with respect to position, orientation, dimensions, current, and number of turns

HelmholtzGraphing.py - creates three helmholtz coils, orientated orthogonally, and plots the magnetic field over a three dimensional region, a set of two dimensional cross sections, and a one dimensional line across the coils
